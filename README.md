### JSDoc publishing
Simplified [JSDoc](http://usejsdoc.org/) publishing that generates versioned documentation, CHANGELOGs and more! Addtional options for auto-deployment via to GitHub pages or other documentation hosting service.

* [Tutorials](https://ugate.github.io/jspub/tutorial-1-start.html)
* [API Docs](https://ugate.github.io/jspub/globals.html)

### Features:
> Versioned documentation:
- Each time docs are tagged/deployed to GitHub or any other `git` supported documentation hosting service, the old docs are archived in a versioned directory
- `versions.json` generation for real-time version selections in previously deployed docs (no more wiping out old docs!)
- Tag filtering option to restrict doc generation for tagged versions that released for `major` or `minor` versions rather than every version that is tagged
> CHANGELOG generation:
- Each time docs are tagged/deployed a CHANGELOG is generated (optional)
- Customizable CHANGELOG __header__ and __lines__ using markdown, [git formatting](https://git-scm.com/docs/pretty-formats) (e.g. `%h`, etc.) and package/publishing parameter substitutions using [Template Literal](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals) syntax
- Customizable [grep](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log#git-log---grepltpatterngt) regular expressions for determining which commit messages will appear in the logs (including support for sub-sectioning into __Breaking Changes__, __Features__ and __Fixes__)
> Page customizations:
- Use virtually any [JSDoc supported template](https://github.com/jsdoc3/jsdoc#templates)- adds a banner to the top of the page with icons linking to the `npm` module (optional), CHANGELOG (optional) and doc version selection
- Branded documentation using your own logo
- Add your own `CSS`, `JavaScript` and `meta` to the documentation pages without altering the chosen template
> Documentation deployment:
- Page deployment execution via [Node.js cli](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html) from the command line or via the provided [API](https://ugate.github.io/jspub/globals.html)
- Easy integration in continuous integration services like [travis-ci](https://travis-ci.com/)
