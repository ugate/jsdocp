Documentation versions are managed via [`npm view <your_package_name> versions --json`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/view). Each published version to `npm` is captured when generating documentation and stored within a `versions.json` file under the `jsdoc` configuration directory set by `opts.destination`. The `versions.json` file contains a simple array of versions that will be loaded via the `jspub` JavaScript ran in the client's browser. During each [deployment](tutorial-1-start.html#deploy) the `versions.json` gets overwritten in the _root_ directory of the branch set by [`opts.jspub.deploy.branch`](tutorial-2-conf.html). This allows both previously and the currently deployed docs to always reference the _latest_ versions in the selection menu presented in the client's browser.
