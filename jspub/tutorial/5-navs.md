The _responsive_ navigation menu that gets injected into the chosen [`jsdoc` template](https://github.com/jsdoc3/jsdoc#templates) can be modified to add a personalized look-and-feel using the provided [`opts.jspub.pages.menu`](tutorial-2-conf.html) configuration options. Everything from the CSS `class` of the menu, an _optional_ `logo` to each of the `icons` displayed can be changed.

### The Logo <sub id="logo"></sub>
By default, no `logo` is used. Only the `package.name` is displayed in the navigation menu. However, if a `logo` is desired there are a few options available. When the [`opts.jspub.pages.menu.logo.src`](tutorial-2-conf.html) is set the `logo` will be rendered as a simple `img`. This option is adequate when styling is not needed, but if the `logo` is in `svg` format and it needs to be styled it falls short. To accommodate `svg` styling, a separate [`opts.jspub.pages.menu.logo.inlineSvgPath`](tutorial-2-conf.html) can be defined that provides a path to an `svg` that will be loaded into the `logo` link as the raw `svg` content rather than an `img`. This permits the [`opts.jspub.pages.menu.logo.className`](tutorial-2-conf.html) to style the `logo` for the `svg` elements (e.g. `fill: red`). For more information on available `logo` options, see the configuration options for [publicize](global.html#publicize).

### The `npm` Package Icon <sub id="npm"></sub>
By default, an `npm` icon/link is displayed that points to `https://www.npmjs.com/package/<your_package_name>` from the `name` defined in `package.json`. This option can be supressed by setting [`opts.jspub.pages.menu.package`](tutorial-2-conf.html) to `none` and can be customized be setting the same option to a value that will be used on the image `src` for the icon. The default icon is rendered as an `svg` so that the icon can be styled/colorized via [`opts.jspub.pages.menu.icons.className`](tutorial-2-conf.html). For more information on available options for `icons`, see the configuration options for [publicize](global.html#publicize).

### The Changelog Icon <sub id="changelog"></sub>
By default, a changelog icon/link is displayed that points to a _parsed_ markdown file called `CHANGELOG.html`. This option can be supressed by setting [`opts.jspub.pages.menu.changelog`](tutorial-2-conf.html) to `none` and can be customized be setting the same option to a value that will be used on the image `src` for the icon. The default icon is rendered as an `svg` so that the icon can be styled/colorized via [`opts.jspub.pages.menu.icons.className`](tutorial-2-conf.html). For more information on available options for `icons`, see the configuration options for [publicize](global.html#publicize).

### The Source Code Icon <sub id="source"></sub>
By default, a source code icon/link is displayed that points to the `homepage` URL set in the `package.json`. This option can be supressed by setting [`opts.jspub.pages.menu.sourceCode`](tutorial-2-conf.html) to `none` and can be customized be setting the same option to a value that will be used on the image `src` for the icon. The default icon is rendered as an `svg` so that the icon can be styled/colorized via [`opts.jspub.pages.menu.icons.className`](tutorial-2-conf.html). For more information on available options for `icons`, see the configuration options for [publicize](global.html#publicize).

### Static Resources <sub id="resources"></sub>
Although they are not technically part of the navigation menu, static resources like `CSS`, `JavaScript` and `meta` can be added using [`opts.jspub.pages.links`](tutorial-2-conf.html), [`opts.jspub.pages.scripts`](tutorial-2-conf.html) and [`opts.jspub.pages.meta`](tutorial-2-conf.html), respectively. `links` and `meta` are added to the `head` of the page while `scripts` are added as the last elements within the `body`. The [example configuration](tutorial-2-conf.html#jspub-example) can be used as a guide as well as the documented options for [publicize](global.html#publicize).
